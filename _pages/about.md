- I am [WU JUNCHAO](https://junchaoiu.github.io) (Âê¥‰øäÊΩÆ). Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [NLP2CT Lab](http://nlp2ct.cis.umac.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/). Previously, I completed my M.S. in Data Science (Computational Lingustics) at the same lab, co-advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/) and [Prof. Yuan Yulin](https://fah.um.edu.mo/yuan-yulin/). I achineved my bachelor's degree at Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, supervised by [Prof. JiangYing](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/glcxyjzx/glcxyjzxrcdw/97671.html) and [Prof. Yangjing](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/yykxyjzx/rcdw2/97903.html). 
- My current research interests are Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation and Trustworthy AI. Please feel free to contact me via email!

Research Interests
======
- Machine Translation: Low-Resource, LLM for MT
- Large Language Models: LLMs Evaluation, LLM-generated Text Detection, Data Selection
- Other Interests: Knowledge Graphs and Ontology, Public Opinion Analysis

News
======
- [2024-05-08] We release a new black-box zero-shot LLM-generated text detection method called **GECScore** üîç, a really simple but effective approach based on the observation that human-written texts often contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts. You can check it on arxiv: *[Who Wrote This? The Key to Zero-Shot LLM-Generated Text Detection Is GECScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04286)*. 
- [2024-01-30] Fortunately, I have been admitted to the Ph.D. program and will continue to pursue my Ph.D. degree in the NLP2CT Lab at UM, starting in August 2024. üí™
- [2023-12-23] Really excited that my girlfriend and I published our first paper. It is worth commemorating this moment. Welcome to access it: *[Evolutionary game analysis of prefabricated buildings adoption under carbon emission trading scheme](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132323011484)*.
- [2023-10-23] Our survey paper on **LLM-generated Text Detection** is now available on arxiv: *[A Survey on LLM-generated Text Detection: Necessity, Methods, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14724)*.
- [2023-10-13] One paper accepted by **MT Summit 2023** as co-author, and is now available on arxiv: *[Human-in-the-loop Machine Translation with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08908)*.
