- I am [WU JUNCHAO](https://junchaoiu.github.io) (Âê¥‰øäÊΩÆ). Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [NLP2CT Lab](http://nlp2ct.cis.umac.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/). Previously, I completed my M.S. in Data Science (Computational Lingustics) at the same lab, co-advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/) and [Prof. Yuan Yulin](https://fah.um.edu.mo/yuan-yulin/). I achineved my bachelor's degree at Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, supervised by [Prof. JiangYing](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/glcxyjzx/glcxyjzxrcdw/97671.html) and [Prof. Yangjing](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/yykxyjzx/rcdw2/97903.html).

- [2025-03-04] üî• We‚Äôre excited to announce a shared task at NLPCC 2025: [LLM-Generated Text Detection](https://github.com/NLP2CT/NLPCC-2025-Task1) !!! This task focuses on Chinese and offers a great opportunity to explore unique findings compared to English detection. Join us and create your own detector now! üöÄ
- [2024-11-31] One paper accepted by **COLING 2025** as first-author: *[Who Wrote This? The Key to Zero-Shot LLM-Generated Text Detection Is GECScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04286)*. We introduce a novel black-box zero-shot method for detecting LLM-generated text, called GECScore üîç. This method is remarkably simple yet effective, based on the observation that LLMs tend to prefer grammatically correcting human-written text over LLM-generated text.
- [2024-11-28] One paper accepted by **Computational Linguistics (CL)** as first-author: *[A Survey on LLM-generated Text Detection: Necessity, Methods, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14724)*. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in LLM-generated text detection, highlighting the urgent need for more robust methods. It reviews mainstream approaches, addresses key challenges, and outlines promising future research directions. The paper serves as both a clear introduction for newcomers and a valuable resource for experts seeking updates in the field.
- [2024-09-27] One paper accepted by **NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track** as first-author: *[DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World Scenarios](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZGMkOikEyv)*. We introduce a new benchmark, **DetectRL**, which covers multiple realistic scenarios, including usage of various prompts, human revisions of LLM-generated text, adversarial spelling errors, taking measures to attack detectors, etc., provide real utility to researchers on the topic and practitioners looking for consistent evaluation methods.

<!-- ËøôÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™Ê≥®ÈáäÔºåËØªËÄÖÁúã‰∏çÂà∞ - [2023-12-23] Really excited that my girlfriend and I published our first paper. It is worth commemorating this moment.
